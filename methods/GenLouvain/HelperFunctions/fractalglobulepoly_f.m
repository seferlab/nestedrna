function [B,twom] = fractalglobulepoly_f(A, D, gamma, alpha)
%MODULARITY returns fractal globule polymer modularity matrix for network given
% by adjacency matrix A and distance matrix D.
%
% Version: 2.2.0
% Date: Mon 26 Aug 2019 
%
%Works for directed and undirected networks
%
%   Input: A:  NxN adjacency matrices of a undirected network
%          D:  NxN distance matrix defined for indicies i, j as |i-j|,
%           explicitly defined as certain regions have uncoded sequences
%          gamma: resolution parameter
%          alpha: decay exponent for fractal globule polymer null-model
%
%   Output: B: function handle where B(i) returns the ith column of
%          [N]x[N] modularity matrix of the monolayer network
%           with adjacency matrix A
%           twom: normalisation constant
%
%   Example of usage: [B, twom]=modularity(A, .7, 1);
%          [S,Q]= genlouvain(B);
%          Q=Q/twom;
%
%   Notes:
%     The matrix A is assumed to be square. This assumption is not checked
%     here.
%
%     By using this code, the user implicitly acknowledges that the authors
%     accept no liability associated with that use.  (What are you doing
%     with it anyway that might cause there to be a potential liability?!?)
